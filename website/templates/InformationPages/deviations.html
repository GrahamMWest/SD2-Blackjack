An advantaged player is able to be profitable should they bet with a proper bet spread and 
play only according to basic strategy. It is recommended that players not focus on playing 
deviations initially and should instead perfect basic strategy. However, should an 
advantaged player want to squeeze maximal value out of card counting, they must also 
master the most profitable deviations from basic strategy. “Roughly 60-80% of a card 
counter’s edge comes from perfect basic strategy, perfect counting, and perfectly betting 
according to the true count. Then, Deviations account for the remaining 20-40%.” [1] The 
following figure is of the Illustrious 18 which are the 18 most profitable playing 
deviations in Blackjack. The order starts with the post profitable deviation.
